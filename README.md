# gadflai

`gadflai` is an experimental programming language. The author's primary goals
are (roughly in order)

- to explore ideas surrounding program synthesis, autonomous agents, and artificial
  intelligence.
- to learn `golang`
- to learn the fundamentals underlying programming language theory and implementation

The primary goal of the `gadflai` language itself is to facilitate the author's
higher-level goals.
