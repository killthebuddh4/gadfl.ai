# gadflai

`gadflai` is an experimental programming language. My (@killthebuddh4) primary goals
are (roughly in order)

- to explore ideas surrounding program synthesis, autonomous agents, and artificial
  intelligence.
- to learn `golang`
- to learn the fundamentals underlying programming language theory and implementation

The primary goal of the `gadflai` language itself is to facilitate my
higher-level goals. I don't want to get too bogged down in the PL details,
because what I really care about is something like _autonomous program
synthesis_, so the first tangible goal is to blow through part 1 of [Crafting
Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) but using `go` instead of
`java`. Part 2 of the book uses `C` to implement a bytecode VM, I'm not sure
whether it will be possible to use `go` and/or whether it will be worth it
otherwise, but we'll see.
